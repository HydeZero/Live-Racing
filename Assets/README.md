# INFO + USES
You are free to make any modifications to this game, provided you:
* Credit me, the original author
* Don't sell it as an different game (More info below), and:
* Don't make profits off of very small modifications (like bug fixes, minor features, etc.)

## So, about that second rule...
"Don't sell it as an different game" is a complicated rule. In a sense, if you modify the game only a little bit (as stated in the third rule), you CANNOT make it an original game. (you can make the modded game avaliable for download, so people can still use it) If you make MAJOR changes (like full-on redesigns, major features, etc.), you CAN sell it as an original game. Just make sure to credit me for the assets and the original game.

Now, with that out of the way, lets now go over...
# How to mod the game
This is divided up into 6 sections. They go, in order, as:
1. Adding new vehicles
2. Modifying old vehicles
3. Adding new tracks
4. Modifying old tracks
5. Adding new mechanics (while preserving the old ones)
6. Modifying old mechanics

After that, you need to import the vehicle into Unity. Make a prefab with this title: "Player[CAR NAME HERE]", replacing [CAR NAME HERE] with the car's name. Then, you
